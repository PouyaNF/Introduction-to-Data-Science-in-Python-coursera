The unpredictable nature of ML and deep learning and their applications in AI, data science and computer vision, make them very exciting. I feel like an ancient explorer, finding a new land when trying to find hidden patterns in a large dataset. Accordingly, with relying on very good knowledge in mathematics and physics, gained within bachelorâ€™s degree, I was confident to choose this filed as my major topic my master degree to pursue in my future career. As a result, with starting my master course, I began a very long learning journey. I have studied in-depth machine learning courses and a student job about CNNs at TU Chemnitz.at the same time I got the advantages of cutting age online courses.  I have been participating in many machine learning and deep learning projects. The building blocks of Deep NNs and CNNs, residual network (ResNet), Car detection with YOLO, implementation of a FaceNet with Keras, art generation with Neural Style Transfer, implementation of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to build a character-level text generation, trigger word detection are among them. \n",
    "I am doing my internship project in AUDI AG in the field of data science and ML in classification and clustering. During this project, I have been testing and analyzing data with both ML and statistical analyses. This program has given me the opportunity to examine my theoretical knowledge in a real industrial environment to gain more intuition in related subjects. \n",

I can assure you will find me a responsible and reliable person with the ability of good teamwork and appropriate communication skills, which allows me to work effectively not only independently but also as a team player. I am quite confident in seeing myself in more significant and more complicated projects. I am very excited and motivated to learn more about possible opportunities at Volkswagen Company and share how I will be an excellent fit for your offering position(s). \n"
